## Post

I've been tinkering with web performance tools for the past few months.

Today I'm putting them all in one place: **Speedkit**

It started as a critical CSS generator — I was tired of manually extracting above-the-fold styles. Then I added preload tag generation. Now it's becoming a toolkit.

**What's in Speedkit today:**

🎯 **Critical CSS Generator**
- Enter any URL
- Get optimized above-fold CSS in ~30 seconds
- Typically 70-90% smaller than your full stylesheet

⚡ **Preload Tag Generator**  
- Analyzes page resources
- Generates preload, preconnect, dns-prefetch tags
- Prioritizes LCP-critical assets

**What's coming:**
- Image optimization analysis
- Unused CSS detector
- Core Web Vitals simulator

**The philosophy:**

I'm not trying to build another Lighthouse. There are enough audit tools.

I want tools that *do the fix*, not just tell you what's broken.

Enter a URL → get the optimized code → paste it into your project.

It's free, it's open source, and I'm building in public.

Link in comments. Feedback welcome — especially edge cases that break things. That's how this gets better.
